Just trying to learn Android by following the tutorial by Marakana.

I encountered and learned about these while making this app.:

1. Making potentially long tasks run on separate threads than the main one.
2. Using Logcat and putting Log.(x) commands in the code
3. Using the AsyncTask thread to run some UI operations.
4. Giving permissions to your app. to perform some otherwise forbidden operations.
